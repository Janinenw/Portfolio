        "My favorite stacks are MERN and pancakes, but I also enjoy Python and waffles from time to time. If I choose function over form, I like there to be an emphasis on 'fun'.  My applications are designed to make mundane tasks such as learning multiplication tables or applying to jobs, as enjoyable as possible.  Much to the the chagrin of my friends and family, I love puns.  When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking and spending my time with my dog, Special Agent Dale Cooper ( who is absolutely as dapper as his namesake)."
