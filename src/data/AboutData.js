        "My favorite stacks are MERN and pancakes, but I also enjoy Python and waffles from time to time. My applications are designed to make mundane tasks such as learning multiplication tables or applying to jobs as efficient and enjoyable as possible.  Much to the chagrin of my friends and family, I love puns.  When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking and spending my time with my dog, Special Agent Dale Cooper (who is absolutely as dapper as his Twin Peaks namesake)."
